----Find the top 5 most expensive products in stock.

SELECT TOP 5 ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, InStock
FROM Products
WHERE InStock > 0
ORDER BY Price DESC;

----Get the total number of products added in the last 30 days

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalProductsAdded
FROM Products
WHERE CreatedAt >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE());

----Show average price per category, sorted by highest to lowest

SELECT Category, AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice
FROM Products
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY AveragePrice DESC;

----- o	Suggest indexes youâ€™d add to improve performance
CREATE INDEX Index_category ON Products(Category);
CREATE INDEX idx_price ON Products(Price);
CREATE INDEX idx_instock ON Products(InStock);

This script creates indexes on the Category, Price, and InStock columns to improve query performance.

CREATE INDEX idx_category_price_instock ON Products(Category, Price, InStock);

This composite index will help improve the performance of queries that involve these columns together. 
However, it's important to consider the order of columns in the index based on your query patterns.

---- o	Write a query to check execution plan for the first query using SET SHOWPLAN_ALL

SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON;

-- Your query to check the execution plan
SELECT TOP 5 ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, InStock
FROM Products
WHERE InStock > 0
ORDER BY Price DESC;

SET SHOWPLAN_ALL OFF;

Also We can include Actual execution plan in SSMS tool to se the plan.
